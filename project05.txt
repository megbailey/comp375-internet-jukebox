5. The number of project bucks you are spending on this project. 
   Remember that one project buck buys you a 24-hour deadline extension.
   However, if you are working with a partner, you must each spend a buck to
   get a 24-hour extension (i.e. 2 total bucks spent).
   You may each spend 0.5 bucks to get a 12-hour extension (i.e. 1 total buck
   between the two of you).
   No other fractional amounts of bucks may be used.
   8 project bucks total, 4 each

   interesting? How could it be improved?)
